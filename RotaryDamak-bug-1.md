# Bug #1: Invalid Future Date Allowed in "Past President" Upload

**Description:**  
The form for uploading a past president is accepting future dates in the "Date" field, which should not be allowed.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Go to admin dashboard â†’ Past Presidents section  
2. Click on "Add New" or "Upload Past President"  
3. Enter required details  
4. In the "Date" field, enter a **future date** (e.g., 2026-01-01)  
5. Submit the form

**Expected Result:**  
Form submission should be rejected with an error like:  
`"Date cannot be in the future for a past president."`

**Actual Result:**  
Form is submitted successfully and future-dated record is saved in the database.
