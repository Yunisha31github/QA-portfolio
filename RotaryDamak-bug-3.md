# Bug #3: Theme Selection Allows Duplicate Options and More Than Two Entries

**Description:**  
While manually testing the Theme section, I observed that the system allows selecting the same theme (e.g., "National") in both dropdowns and also allows adding more than two themes. This violates the expected behavior that only **one National** and **one International** theme should be added, and only **two total themes** should exist.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Go to the admin dashboard â†’ Theme section  
2. Click on "Add Theme"  
3. In the first dropdown, select "National"  
4. In the second dropdown, again select "National" (still available)  
5. Submit the form  
6. Add a third theme using the "Add Theme" button

**Expected Result:**  
- Once "National" is selected in one dropdown, it should be **disabled or hidden** in the other  
- The system should **only allow one "National" and one "International"** theme to be submitted  
- After submitting two themes, the **"Add Theme" button** should be **disabled or hidden**

**Actual Result:**  
- I was able to select "National" in both dropdowns  
- I was able to add more than two themes  
- No validation or restriction was applied either on the frontend or backend

**Severity:** Medium  
**Tools Used:** Trello, Chrome DevTools  
**Status:** Open (Reported)

**Notes from Manual Testing:**  
- The dropdown options remained unchanged even after selecting one  
- I could select "National" for both fields without any warning  
- I could add a third theme entry without restriction

**Suggested Fix (for dev team):**  
- Apply logic to **disable already selected options** in the second dropdown  
- Add **backend validation** to ensure only one National and one International theme can be stored  
- After two themes are added, disable or hide the **"Add Theme" button** to prevent further entries
